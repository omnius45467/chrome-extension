It uses [buffer-crc32](https://www.npmjs.org/package/buffer-crc32) behind the scenes to reliably handle binary data and fancy character sets. Data comes through compressed with [zlib.DeflateRaw](http://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html#zlib_class_zlib_deflateraw).\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThis module has been merged into [CRC32Stream](https://www.npmjs.org/package/crc32-stream). No future updates will be made to this module.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar CRC32Stream = require('deflate-crc32-stream');\r\n\r\nvar source = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');\r\nvar deflate = new DeflateCRC32Stream();\r\n\r\ndeflate.on('end', function(err) {\r\n  // do something with deflate.digest() here\r\n});\r\n\r\n// either pipe it\r\nsource.pipe(deflate);\r\n\r\n// or write it\r\ndeflate.write('string');\r\ndeflate.end();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Instance API\r\n\r\nInherits [zlib.DeflateRaw](http://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html#zlib_class_zlib_deflateraw) methods.\r\n\r\n#### digest()\r\n\r\nReturns the checksum digest in unsigned form.\r\n\r\n#### hex()\r\n\r\nReturns the hexadecimal representation of the checksum digest. (ie E81722F0)\r\n\r\n#### size(compressed)\r\n\r\nReturns the raw uncompressed size/length of passed-through data.\r\n\r\nIf `compressed` is `true`, it returns compressed length instead.\r\n\r\n### Instance Options\r\n\r\nInherits [zlib.DeflateRaw](http://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html#zlib_class_zlib_deflateraw) options.\r\n\r\n## Things of Interest\r\n\r\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/ctalkington/node-deflate-crc32-stream/releases)\r\n- [Contributing](https://github.com/ctalkington/node-deflate-crc32-stream/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [MIT License](https://github.com/ctalkington/node-deflate-crc32-stream/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT)","maintainers":[{"name":"ctalkington","email":"chris@christalkington.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-26T13:00:46.382Z","created":"2014-05-26T16:30:27.926Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-26T16:30:27.926Z","0.1.1":"2014-05-26T16:52:59.574Z","0.1.2":"2014-08-26T12:58:28.183Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ctalkington/node-deflate-crc32-stream","keywords":["deflate","crc32-stream","crc32","stream","checksum"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ctalkington/node-deflate-crc32-stream.git"},"author":{"name":"Chris Talkington","url":"http://christalkington.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ctalkington/node-deflate-crc32-stream/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"756YRWW52V8NZJLVKMX608E0R\""}
