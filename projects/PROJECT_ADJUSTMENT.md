Fixes to make after creating a project with yeoman
==================================================

After you setup a yeoman project, you may need to change two things in **Gruntfile.js**:

+   Comment out *test* task for normal build - Chrome does not seem to be available on this Ubuntu box. It is at the real end as part of default task's dependencies
+   Grunt needs to listen on **0.0.0.0**  or __*__, not just **localhost** - the instructions are in the Gruntfile.js itself, just search for **localhost**
